function [xconv] = propagationOperator(x,H,varargin)
% [xconv] = propagationOperator(x,H,varargin)
%
%   This function performs a convolution of image X by the kernel H in the
%   Fourier space. 
%
%   In VARGARIN, 2 parameters can be given:
%   - FLAG_PAD: if true (default: true), a zero-padding will be performed 
%   provided that the size of H is doubled compared with the size of X.
%   - EXT_VAL: to set only if FLAG_TRANSP=false (default: 0). It specifies 
%   the value to set outside the initial field of view. 
%
%   Note: the kernel H is already "fftshifted".
